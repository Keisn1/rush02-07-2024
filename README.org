** Make fclean
- "make fclean" is a custom target added to a Makefile to clean up the project build artifacts
- The "fclean" target usually removes all files generated by the build process, such as executables, object files, intermediate files, and any other build artifacts, leaving the project directory in a clean state as if it was just cloned.
- It is often used to ensure a fresh and clean build environment before starting a new build.
