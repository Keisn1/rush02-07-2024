** Make fclean
- "make fclean" is a custom target added to a Makefile to clean up the project build artifacts
- The "fclean" target usually removes all files generated by the build process, such as executables, object files, intermediate files, and any other build artifacts, leaving the project directory in a clean state as if it was just cloned.
- It is often used to ensure a fresh and clean build environment before starting a new build.

** Makefile
#+begin_src makefile
all: example
%: %.c ; cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o $@ $<
clean: ; rm -f example
#+end_src
*** first line
- =all= is a label
- The =all= target specifies the executable name to be created (=example=).
*** seconde line
- The pattern rule =%: %.c= specifies how to build the executable from its corresponding source file.
